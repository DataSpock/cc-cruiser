-All codes for deep-learning convolutional neural networks were executed in the Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) framework with Ubuntu 14.04 64bit + CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).
-The /DL-Source code/createdata contains the dataset for one-time training and testing. The training and testing records are saved as test.txt and train.txt. The script "create_imagenet.sh" is used to generate the dataset. The file "make_imagenet_mean.sh" is used to generate the mean file for dataset accordingly.
-The file "train.sh" in /DL-Source code/myself is used for network training.
-The file "test.sh" in / DL-Source code/myself is used for testing.
-The ¡°yunxing_cnn.py¡± in /DL-Source code/python_script could be used to test and have the evaluation indices.
